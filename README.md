This project is a Web Application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

It allows users to enter a numerical value, limited to a maximum of 9 digits. Upon input, the application provides conversions for the entered value in three different categories: Length, Volume, and Mass.

In the **Length category**, the application calculates how many feet correspond to the entered value in meters, as well as how many meters correspond to the entered value in feet.

In the **Volume category**, the application converts the entered value from liters to gallons and vice versa, providing both conversions.

In the **Mass category**, the application converts the entered value from pounds to kilograms and from kilograms to pounds, displaying both results.

This project provides a user-friendly interface for performing quick and convenient unit conversions in the areas of Length, Volume, and Mass.
